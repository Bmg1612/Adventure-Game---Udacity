# Adventure-Game---Udacity
This a simple program in Python that imitates and old-fashioned adventure game.

## Structure
I divided the scenarios in the game into functions so it would get organized. For example:

There is a function for the time the user is on the field (ex: `field()`), house, place and fight.

The `main`function is for the input of the user.

## Randomness
Both the creature and the place are chosen randomly. I created a list for each and used the `random.choice`.

## Requirements
You have to import the `time` and `random` libraries in order for this code to work. On the code is already imported

## Contribution
Any suggestion and tips would be gratly appreciated, thanks!
